# VR-Project

## Abstract
The topic of the project was to develop a mixed reality application, utilising a large projector as output and speech recognition as input. By this means an application was to be build, which enhances the cocktailmixing experience.

An instructional interactive helper software was build, which teaches the user how to create a cocktail from a list of prepared recipes. A beamer projects a list of available cocktails onto a table, from which the user can choose the prefered recipee. The input is given via speech, by saying the number of the respective item.

After a recipee has been selected the user will be navigated to the preparation, in which the needed incredients and tools will be displayed on the table, with a prompt telling the user to place the items on the highlighted area with the respective labled. The user is instructed to say *Next* when all preparations are ready. 

In doing so the first recipe step will be displayed. All incredients and tools needed for this step will be highlighted by the projector. A text prompt will describe the action performed with the highlighted incredients, e.g. *Pour juice into cocktail glass. Add ice to the glass*. To visually aid how the task is performed, a video play in the top right corner, showing the action described in the text instruction. The video will loop until the step is completed. Once the user has successfully performed the instructed task, he will need to again place the incredients and tools onto the labled position. In order to continue to the next step, the user is prompted to say *Next*, which will lead to the step in the recipe until the cocktail is finished, where the user is presented with a finishing screen.
